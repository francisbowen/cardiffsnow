<p>The first board we reach for when storm totals crest into double digits, the Powgoda is a playful, pow-centric design that will remind you why you started snowboarding. Designed for the deep but fully capable in a wide variety of conditions, the Powgoda floats, carves, slashes, and butters with ease. Our original HALFcamber50 design (with camber underfoot on 50% of the deck), along with a perfectly matched pivot point under the front foot, inspires confidence in deep snow, helps you stay afloat and serves up premium maneuverability. BOARDERpatrol technology uses poplar stringer which fuses with the UNIwall seamless urethane sidewall to reinforce the edge and provide an incredibly damp ride. Sam Bawden created the Powgoda's original artwork, inspired by the complex joinery and sophisticated design of Japan's Hōryū-ji pagoda, one of the oldest wooden buildings in the world.</p>
