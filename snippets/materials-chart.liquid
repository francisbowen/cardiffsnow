    <h4>Pro Carbon</h4>
    <h6>For those that demand cutting edge ultralight gear</h6>
    <p class="int-sm-r-2">This is a true 100% carbon fiber construction build. The core is a lightweight poplar + paulownia mix with vertically laid aluminum strips which balances the carbon to give it a more damp ride. in our splitboard models we added reinforcements under the toe piece and the ENDUROcap. On the solid version we use our urethane SHOWtopper finish, which allows for quick and easy snow shedding.</p>
