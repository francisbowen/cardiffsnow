<p>From high-speed arcs on the hardpack to soaring airs and elegant lines down the steep and deep, the Crane is our freestyle-oriented freeride board that flies free on the full gamut of terrain. Our patent-pending HALFcamber65 design (with camber underfoot on 65% of the deck), along with a perfectly matched pivot point near the center of the board, offers more traditional all-mountain twin performance that's equally composed on edge or in the air. To complement the tighter sidecut radius, we added our SPEEDbumps - reverse sidecut bumps aligned with the bindings to add grip when the board is on edge in firm conditions. BOARDERpatrol technology uses poplar stringer which fuses with the UNIwall seamless urethane sidewall to reinforce the edge and provide an incredibly damp ride. Kyson Dana created the Crane's original artwork, which channels the elegant and fine-tuned craft found within.</p>
