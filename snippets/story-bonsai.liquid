<p>Our purest expression of freeride performance, the Bonsai was designed around the desire for a simple and streamlined board that could handle it allâ€”it has raced in boarder cross events, carves spring corn, and offers incredible performance in deep conditions. The Bonsai features our FLOATilla construction, which combines a big, wide nose with the gradual rocker of our patent-pending HALFcamber60 (camber underfoot on 60% of the deck). The result is a shorter board with increased float. The Bonsai's BOARDERpatrol technology uses poplar stringer which fuses with the UNIwall seamless urethane sidewall to reinforce the edge and provide an incredibly damp ride. Original artwork by Sam Bawden features the gnarled and resilient bristlecone pines found along the high ridgelines of our home Wasatch Range - trees that experience and endure an incredible range of winter conditions.</p>
