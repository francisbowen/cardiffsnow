<p>Our big-mountain snow surfer designed for steep lines and all-time conditions, the Swell is the board for those out searching for the ultimate ride. The Swell's unique, ocean-inspired shape combines a wide, ultra-floaty tip, the gradual rocker of our HALFcamber60 design, 30mm of taper, and our Wingpin tail - which makes for quick and nimble maneuverability in tight terrain - to create a board that rides the wave without the need to paddle out. The board's BOARDERpatrol technology uses poplar stringer which fuses with the UNIwall seamless urethane sidewall to reinforce the edge and provide an incredibly damp ride. For the Swell's original artwork, Sam Bawden expressed the board's dual inspirations of fine-tuned woodcraft and ocean-inspired performance.</p>
